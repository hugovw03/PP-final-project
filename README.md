# PP boilerplate projects

This zip contains three boilerplate projects:

- `maven-my-lang`: A Maven boilerplate project for a compiler written in Java 11 to Java 17.
- `stack-my-lang`: A Haskell Stack boilerplate project for a compiler written in Haskell.
- `maven-stack-my-lang`: A Maven boilerplate project, containing a Haskell Stack boilerplate project, for a compiler written in a mix of Java 11 to 17 & Haskell.

Obviously, the "my lang" name is used everywhere as a placeholder. We encourage you to come up with your own name. For further documentation, we refer to the READMEs in the individual folders, and the documentation of the individual tools.
